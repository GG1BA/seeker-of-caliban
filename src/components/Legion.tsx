        The Dark Angels, known in High Gothic as Angelis Tenebraium, have the
        honour of being the first Space Marine Legion created by The Emperor of
        Mankind. Their origins are however shrouded in mystery and secrecy,
        though it is said their Gene-Seed was in production a century before the
        end of the Unification Wars.
      </p>
      <p className="legion-text">
        During their earliest days Prototype Space Marines such as Abraxus Ghent
        were created from the Gene-Seed of Lion El'Jonson and served as the
        template for later Astartes to come. Known as the Primordial Strain,
        almost none of these initial prototypes are known to not have survived
        the process of becoming Space Marines but they nonetheless formed the
        basis of the initial culture of the First Legion. The subjects of these
        early experiments were recruited from genetically pure and uncorrupted
        inhabitants of Terra, themselves hard to find amid the many Atomic wars
        and genetic plagues. The Emperor mainly acquired such subjects through
        captured foes and purchasing slaves from nomadic clans. As a result the
        earliest Dark Angels were diverse culturally and recruited from across
        Terra, in contrast with most of the other Legions during their earliest
        days. The First Legion became the crucible in which all the cultures of
        Old Night combined with the Emperor's genetic prowess to create a new
        and formidable strain of warrior.

      <p className="legion-text">
        In the earliest days of the Great Crusade the First pushed out of the
        Sol System, cleansing the Oort Cloud and keeping watch along the
        Heliopause border for terrors that sought to slip into the Emperor's new
        realm. They also liberated the outermost edges of the Sol System,
        recovering whatever few Human survivors could be found. By this point
        the Legion had become isolated and developed a complex culture of
        ciphers and rituals alongside the creation of the first specialized
        Orders. Upon their return from the outer Sol System their grey armor had
        been changed to pitch black. Upon their return they mustered at Saturn,
        where the Emperor gifted them a fleet of ancient but highly advanced
        warships. In the ensuing Great Crusade across the greater Galaxy the
        First Legion continued their role as exterminators, using forbidden
        Archaeotech such as Gene-Phages and Rad-Waves to annihilate enemies
        deemed too terrible to face in open battle. As other Legions and
        Expeditionary Fleet oversaw the colonization and compliance of countless
        worlds The First fought nightmarish creatures and Xenos without
        hesitation or complaint. Many of their campaigns, such as those as
        Behtelgen IV, have been deemed classNameified and thus to many the early
        career of the First Legion seems lacking.
      </p>
      <p className="legion-text">
        These trials would face the Legion into a fearsome weapon and its Legion
        Master stood as the Left Hand of the Emperor. This role continued even
        as early Primarchs such as Leman Russ were rediscovered, with the Legion
        Master being 3rd in the Imperial Court after Malcador and Horus. However
        amid the countless battles the Hosts of the Hexagrammaton, once an
        ever-shifting body of knowledge that changed to meet each challenge, had
        become stagnant. The warriors of the First assumed they had reached the
        apex of skill and could learn no more. Recruitment from outside their
        enclaves on Terra was minimal and each battle led them further down the
        path of arrogance. Tradition and ritual became more valued than
        innovation, and each Order and Host jealously guarded their small
        fragments of lore. The Legion began to turn in upon itself as other
        Legions such as the Luna Wolves, Ultramarines, and Imperial Fists had
        grown in prestige and number of triumphs. The final blow for the
        Legion's fragile pride came at Canis-Balor where the First was overcome
        by an unknown Xenos breed and Exterminatus was enacted at the cost of
        Grandmaster Thrane's life.
      </p>
      <p className="legion-text">
        In the aftermath of the Canis-Balor debacle turmoil swept the Legion as
        the various Orders and Hosts struggled for primacy. To settle this
        problem the First Legion held a great Council at Gramarye that saw
        bitter vitriol and admonition. The Council was unable to choose a new
        Grandmaster, forcing Malcador to intervene and choose Urian Vendraig.
        Vendraig's new task was to unify and rejuvenate the Legion and in an
        unprecedented move allowed Remembrancers to stay by his side and
        document the First Legion's ascension. Shortly therafter, the Imperium
        encountered the vicious Rangda. In their initial campaigns against the
        Rangad at Advex-Mors the First Legion lost 5,000 Astartes over four
        months. In the initial Rangdan Xenocides the divisions of the Legion
        were only exacerbated. At Karkasarn the First Legion attempted to regain
        its glory, only for Grandmaster Vendraig to meet his end after launching
        a hasty assault.
      </p>
      <p className="legion-text">
        Vendraig's death stung the First Legion hard, as did Roboute Guilliman's
        scolding of them at the end of the battle. Command of the Legion fell to
        the Council of Masters who split it across the stars to seek vindication
        in conquest. They gave battle without remorse and without regard for
        their own life. The 9th and 14th Chapters took the coral citadels of
        Melnoch from the Fra'al in a single night at the cost of a tenth of
        their own, all to outpace the Luna Wolves elsewhere in the cluster. Upon
        Vorsingun a force of 1,000 Initiates and 4,000 war engines of the Host
        of Iron battled an Ork horde over three times its size. They prevailed,
        but again at a fearsome price. Yet for each victory the Legion could not
        regain its former reputation. By the mid Great Crusade they had become
        known as grim death-seekers as each Chapter, Host, and Order waged its
        own independent wars.

        However, the fortune of the Legion changed dramatically when the First
        Legion's Primarch Lion El'Jonson was discovered on Caliban. Upon reunion
        with his Legion The Lion tested his sons mettle by dueling the captain
        of the company presented before him. Though not clad in Power Armour and
        facing a Terminator-clad captain, The Lion bested his foe and it is said
        both sides learned respect for the other. From that day forth The Lion
        renamed the Legion the Dark Angels. Announced by the Primarch, the
        connotation was in fact first drawn by his mentor Luther, who quoted a
        section from the legend upon first seeing Astartes descending using jump
        packs:
